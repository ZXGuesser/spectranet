Minimal flash identifier tool.

Works with flash chips using 0x5555 and 0x2AAA programming addresses
(e.g. SST39SF0x0)

Does not depend on Spectranet RAM being present, will work on a Spectranet
board that just contains the CPLD and flash memory. Uses the Spectrum ROM
print routine to write its output.
